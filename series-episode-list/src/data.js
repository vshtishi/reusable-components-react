      desc: "Socially inept Elliot Alderson works at cyber security company Allsafe. At night, he hacks social media, personal information, and bank records, including those of his co-workers, therapist, and drug dealer. Elliot stops a DDoS attack against Allsafe's biggest client, E Corp. He identifies a file labeled fsociety00.dat and a text file asking him not to destroy malware he finds hidden on E Corp's server. Mr. Robot, the mysterious leader of the hacker group fsociety, contacts Elliot on the subway. Fsociety invites Elliot to join them in starting a digital revolution; they plan to delete all debt records held by E Corp. He is intrigued and eventually agrees. As his first collaborative act with fsociety, Elliot provides the FBI with an encrypted file falsely implicating Terry Colby, E Corp's own chief technology officer (CTO) as the orchestrator of the attack.",

Meanwhile, Cisco, an unknown associate of the Chinese hacker group The Dark Army, hacks Ollie's home computer with a CD.
